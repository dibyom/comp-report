	Sketchup 2013 and OpenStudio v.1.2 were used to model the building and then convert it to the EnergyPlus readable IDF format.The match photo feature of Sketchup was used to model the building exterior. Four photographs from each of the four corners of the building were used. The interior of the building was modeled with the help of floor plans provided by the Allegheny College Physical Plant. The Open Studio plugin for Sketchup was used to transform the Sketchup Model into thermal zones using the secondary school template. This template provided automatic defaults for the people usage loads as well as a schedule for how the loads differed on weekdays, weekends, and holidays.
