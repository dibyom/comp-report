abstract = {A simulation-optimization tool is developed and applied to optimize building shape and building envelope features. The simulation-optimization tool couples a genetic algorithm to a building energy simulation engine to select optimal values of a comprehensive list of parameters associated with the envelope to minimize energy use for residential buildings. Different building shapes were investigated as part of the envelope optimization, including rectangle, L, T, cross, U, H, and trapezoid. Moreover, building envelope features were considered in the optimization analysis including wall and roof constructions, foundation types, insulation levels, and window types and areas. The results of the optimization indicate rectangular and trapezoidal shaped buildings consistently have the best performance (lowest life-cycle cost) across five different climates. It was also found that rectangle and trapezoid exhibit the least variability from best to worst within the shape.},

abstract = {Since buildings have considerable impacts on the environment, it has become necessary to pay more attention to environmental performance in building design. However, it is a difficult task to find better design alternatives satisfying several conflicting criteria, especially, economical and environmental performance. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model that could assist designers in green building design. Variables in the model include those parameters that are usually determined at the conceptual design stage and that have critical influence on building performance. Life cycle analysis methodology is employed to evaluate design alternatives for both economical and environmental criteria. Life cycle environmental impacts are evaluated in terms of expanded cumulative exergy consumption, which is the sum of exergy consumption due to resource inputs and abatement exergy required to recover the negative impacts due to waste emissions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to find optimal solutions. A case study is presented and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for identifying a number of Pareto optimal solutions for green building design.},

@article{Castro-Lacouture2009,
abstract = {Buildings have a significant and continuously increasing impact on the environment because they are responsible for a large portion of carbon emissions and use a considerable number of resources and energy. The green building movement emerged to mitigate these effects and to improve the building construction process. This paradigm shift should bring significant environmental, economic, financial, and social benefits. However, to realize such benefits, efforts are required not only in the selection of appropriate technologies but also in the choice of proper materials. Selecting inappropriate materials can be expensive, but more importantly, it may preclude the achievement of the desired environmental goals. In order to help decision-makers with the selection of the right materials, this study proposes a mixed integer optimization model that incorporates design and budget constraints while maximizing the number of credits reached under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. To illustrate this model, this paper presents a case study of a building in Colombia in which a modified version of LEED is proposed.},

Energy simulations are executed with TRNSYS. The ecological impact is evaluated through a life cycle inventory of the whole building, whereas costs are evaluated through a cost-benefit analysis. The multi-objective optimization problem is tackled by combining genetic algorithms and the Pareto concept. First, the optimization methodology is presented. Subsequently, the validity as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology are discussed. Finally, the main results are presented followed by a discussion of the trade-off curves of primary energy consumption and net present value, an analysis of the embodied energy, and a study of the impact of economic parameters, such as price evolutions above inflation and discount rate.},

abstract = {Building optimization involving multiple objectives is generally an extremely time-consuming process. The GAINN approach presented in this study first uses a simulation-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to characterize building behaviour, and then combines this ANN with a multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimization. The methodology has been used in the current study for the optimization of thermal comfort and energy consumption in a residential house. Results of ANN training and validation are first discussed. Two optimizations were then conducted taking variables from HVAC system settings, thermostat programming, and passive solar design. By integrating ANN into optimization the total simulation time was considerably reduced compared to classical optimization methodology. Results of the optimizations showed significant reduction in terms of energy consumption as well as improvement in thermal comfort. Finally, thanks to the multiobjective approach, dozens of potential designs were revealed, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption.},

The paper reviews current trends in simulation-based building performance optimization (BPO) and outlines major criteria for optimization tools selection and evaluation. This is based on analyzing user's needs for tools capabilities and requirement specifications. The review is carried out by means of a literature review of 165 publications and interviews with 28 optimization experts. The findings are based on an inter-group comparison between experts. The aim is to assess the gaps and needs for integrating BPO tools in NZEB design. The findings indicate a breakthrough in using evolutionary algorithms in solving highly constrained envelope, HVAC and renewable optimization problems. Simple genetic algorithm solved many design and operation problems and allowed measuring the improvement in the optimality of a solution against a base case. Evolutionary algorithms are also easily adapted to enable them to solve a particular optimization problem more effectively. However, existing limitations including model uncertainty, computation time, difficulty of use and steep learning curve. Some future directions anticipated or needed for improvement of current tools are presented.},

This paper couples a population-based optimisation algorithm (a genetic algorithm) to a dynamic thermal model with the idea of identifying large numbers of distinctly different low-energy designs. These designs are then presented to the user in the form of a visual summary for judgement as to potential use. In order that sufficiently different designs are evolved, and the thermal model can be run over a complete year on an hourly grid, several adaptations to the genetic algorithm have had to be made. The approach is illustrated by the design of a community hall. An extensive range of design possibilities is identified which achieve low-energy status by greatly different means with some concentrating on reducing losses and others on maximising their use of causal gains, including solar gains.},

What is GA?
Why GA? 
-  Most traditional optimisation techniques that might be applied suf- fer from the drawback that only a single result is obtained. Because of the diculty of including such factors as aes- thetics in the optimisation process, it is likely that any “op- timum” result will be found to be unacceptable. Traditional approaches also have diculty navigating through search spaces that contain local optima, and there are likely to be many in such a problem.

abstract = {The potential of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) is not sufficiently exploited in current building design practice. I argue that this field of engineering requires a special setup of the optimization model that considers the uniqueness of buildings, and allows the designer to interact with the optimization in order to assess qualities of aesthetics, expression, and building function. For this reason, the approach applies a performance optimization based on resource consumption extended by preference criteria. Furthermore, building design-specific components serve for the decomposition and an interactive way of working. The component scheme follows the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a common Building Information Model (BIM) standard in order to allow a seamless integration into an interactive CAD working process in the future. A representative case study dealing with a frame-based hall design serves to illustrate these considerations. An N-Square diagram or Design Structure Matrix (DSM) represents the system of components with the disciplinary dependencies and workflow of the analysis. The application of a Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) leads to demonstrable results.},

abstract = {Considering energy efficiency and sustainable development on one side and economy aspects on the other, optimal building design has to meet two confronted demands: to minimize total cost of the construction and to minimize energy consumption, which is usually obtained by implementation of expensive insulation and equipment. This paper presents solving methodology using evolutionary algorithm improved by introducing the tabu search module and combined with EnergyPlus software. The results are demonstrated on the example of optimization of insulation materials and orientation angle of a given building, confirming that proposed methodology successfully meets design demands.},
