\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

\section{Summary of Results}

\section{Threats to validity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Inaccurate thermal modeling of case-study building
	\item Energy consumption for building as reported by EnergyPlus not verified with actual consumption records
	\item Weather file for Meadville PA not found in the NREL database. Using Erie/Pittsburgh instead.
	\item Cost is based on energy rates for only one year. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Expanding building variables.
	\item Life cycle study -> considering life cycle energy impact of the building materials
	\item Modularizing the system. Ability for user to choose variables etc.
	\item Improving the cost function to include rates of change in natural gas/electricity/labor prices. Amortized payment over a period of time.
	\item Closer integration with OpenStudio using their Ruby user scripts.
\end{itemize}
